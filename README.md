Hi, thanks for trying out KeypresSfx

To launch the program double click the exec in the first directory called KeypresSfx

It might ask for permissions for keypresses because the program is listening for keypresses to play the sounds.

The program runs in a terminal window

The startup process takes a second or two based on how fast your processor is.

You will know that the program is working correctly IF:

You see:
